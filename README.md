## üìä What It Shows

- A color-coded bar chart animation of phoneme acquisition over time.
- Each phoneme is grouped by manner of articulation:
  - **Stop/Plosives**
  - **Nasals & Approximants**
  - **Fricatives & Affricates**
- Data is shown in 3-month increments from 30 to 96 months.
- Colors indicate mastery level:
  - üî¥ Less than 50% of children produce this phoneme in single words
  - üü† 50% of children produce this phoneme in single words
  - üü° 75% of children produce this phoneme in single words
  - üü¢ 90% of children produce this phoneme in single words
